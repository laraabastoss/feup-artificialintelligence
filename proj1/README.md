# IA Project 1 - Even More Pizza

This project aims to implement a solution for the Even More Pizza problem from the Hash Code competition. Multiple optimization algorithms with different parameterizations were developed. Additionally, an interface was added to help users experiment and learn about the algorithms' performance.


# Execution

You should start by installing the addition libraries used:

```sh
pip install -U tqdm
```

```sh
pip install PyQt5
```

```
pip install pyqt5-tools
```

Finally, to run the program:

```sh
python src/main.py
````

# Usage

After running the program, you will see the interface. To test an algorithm, follow these steps:

- Select one of the files to use.
- Select one of the five implemented algorithms to run.
- Fill in the parameters asked for that algorithm. If none are added, the default values will be used.

# Results

After running, the score of the best solution found will be shown. Additionally, there will be a graph showing some of the metrics relevant to understanding the algorithm's performance.

To run a different algorithm, the user should close the graph and choose new parameters.
